1. What is difference between for loop and while loop in python?


-Initialization, conditional checking, and increment or decrement is done while iteration in “for” loop executed.
 while on the other hand, only initialization and condition checking in the syntax can be done.


-For loop is used when we are aware of the number iterations at the time of execution.
on the other hand, in “while” loop, we can execute it even if we are not aware of the number of iterations.

-If you forgot to put the conditional statement in for loop, it will reiterate the loop infinite times 
but if you forgot to put the conditional statement in while loop, it will show an error to you.


-The syntax in the for loop will be executed only when the initialization statement is on the top of the syntax but in case of while loop, 
it doesn’t matter whether initialization statement finds anywhere in the syntax.

-The iteration will be executed on if the body of the loop executes. on the contrary,
 the iteration statement in while loop can be written anywhere in the syntax.
